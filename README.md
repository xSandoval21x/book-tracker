# myBookshelf
A digital book shelf made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript<br>
Project from the Odin Project curriculum

### Project Description
* Digital bookshelf used to keep track of books users have or want to read
* Tracks book title, author, pages, and read status (Read/Not Read)
* Add entry form allows users to add as many books as they want
* Remove button on each row allows users to remove book entries
* Change status button allows users to change the read status of each book
    
### Project Reflection
* This was a good project for working with an array of objects
* I have learned about classes and objects so this was a good refresher
* I am getting even more comfortable with adding event listeners and DOM manipulation
* I used a table element which I hadn't really used before
* Got practice with adding and removing table rows
* I notice I am getting quicker with the javascript, but I still am taking a long time with the CSS
